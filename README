# Food Pantry Data Automation
Downloads and processes economic and school-related datasets used for food pantry demand forecasting. It fetches data from public sources (FRED & USDA SNAP) and stores them locally as Excel files.

# Overview:
- CPI (Consumer Price Index)
- UER (Unemployment Rate)
- EMHI (Median Household Income)
- School Days (weekly estimate of Auburn City Schools instructional days)
- SNAP Data (USDA participation and cost data)

All output files are saved inside the data_downloads/ directory.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project:
   git clone https://github.com/jkolb024/pantry_demand_v1.git

2. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
In Python:
   from fetch_data import update_all()
   update_all()

By default, this fetches data from 2015 through the current year.

## Output
All files are saved in the data_downloads/ folder.
- CPI.xlsx - Consumer Price Index from FRED
- UER.xlsx - Unemployment Rate from FRED
- EMHI.xlsx - Median Household Income from FRED
- Auburn_Weekly_Schooldays_Estimate.xlsx - Weekly school days estimate
- SNAP files - Extracted from USDA ZIP archive

## File Descriptions:
   fetch_data.py - Coordinates all downloads and updates datasets
   fred_data.py - Retrieves CPI, UER, and EMHI data from FRED
   schooldays.py - Estimates weekly Auburn school days
   snap_data.py - Finds and downloads the latest USDA SNAP ZIP file

## Configuration:
You can change the range of years in the call to update_all():
- update_all(start_year=2018, end_year=2024)

You can change the range of years and select the specfic variable in the call
to get_fred_variable():
- get_fred_variable("cpi", start_year=2013, end_year=2014)

## Future Possible Improvements:
- Add error handling and logging for failed downloads
- Validate data completeness before saving
- Add timestamps to filenames for version tracking
- Add tests with mock data sources
- Automatically create separate Excel files for each SNAP variable
- Logic for predicting school days could be fine tuned more
